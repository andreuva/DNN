This is the repository of a project developed in the Summer of High Perfomance Computing (SoHPC).
It is based on applying deep neural networks to do image processing in an HPC sistem and then export it to an edge device.

To work with this notebooks, download the data and put it in a folder named "data" or change the path in the notebook.


To get the data, the models and the log files you can go to:
